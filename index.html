        <h2>(~$ whoami)</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my website. I was getting frustrated with LinkedIn. It is the fourth time my LinkedIn account got locked out or "banned". I confirmed I am not doing anything that either is suspicious or malicious. I don't know what their reasoning is for icing me out.<br><br>I decided to create a portfolio/website. This is a static website, nothing fancy and straight to the point. Since I am not a web developer I am learning as I go along, which at the same time I will beautify this. The main objective of this portfolio/website is to showcase myself and to connect/network with individual(s) or companies.<br><br>The contents will be mostly about Cybersecurity, but I will also include none Cybersecurity contents.</p>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Miguel. I am based out of British Columbia, Canada. I am Cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience with offensive and defensive. I tend to lean more into the offensive side, but at the same time I still like the defensive side. I consider myself a "jack of all trades, master of none".This resonate with anyone in the Information Technology field or in the Cybersecurity field. Whatever the tasking(s) is, I will get it done.<br><br>Currently, I am actively seeking employment in a Cybersecurity role that would be either offensive or defensive. Ideally I would want the job to be local to me, but I am flexible if the job is fully remote.

                <h3>April 2025: Practical SOC Analyst (PSAA) lab</h3>
                <p>I built a virtualized environment that comprise of a virtual Ubuntu machine and a virtual Windows to practice various Blue Teaming TTP(tactics, techniques, procedures) such as network traffic analysis, log analysis, phishing analysis, and other methodologies.</p>Below are the following tools that were used.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wireshark</li>
                        <li>TCP Dump</li>

                <p>I built a virtualized environment that comprise of a virtual Windows Active Directory, two virtual Windows machines, and one attacker machine that is Kali Linux to practice various Penetration Testing TTP(tactics, techniques, procedures) such as LLMNR poisoning, Pass the hash/Pass the Password, token impersonation, kerberoasting, golden ticket attack, SMB relay attack, and IPv6 DNS attack.<br><br>Below are the following tools that were used on specific attacks.<br></p>

                <h3>April 2024: Raspberry Pi wireless Penetration Test box</h3>
                <p>Configured a Raspberry Pi to a wireless Penetration Test box to learn wifi attack such on WPA2-PSK. I installed Kali Linux onto the Raspberry Pi. The built-in wifi adapter is compatible, so I was able to conduct a wireless Penetration Test. I used Aircrack-ng for the wifi attack.</p>This is one of the setup guide I used for this project, <a href="https://raspberrytips.com/hacking-wifi-raspberry-pi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Setup Raspberry Pi as wifi Pentest box</a>

                <p>Configured a ESP32-CAM to be a camera. I used two resources to complete the project; <a href="https://lastminuteengineers.com/getting-started-with-esp32-cam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting started with a esp32-cam</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx09GFGgVwA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create a Wi-Fi Spy Camera with an ESP32-CAM</a>.

                <li>Bsides Vancouver 2025</li>

                <h3>October 12, 2025</h3>
                <p>Since it is the obligatory Cybersecurity awareness month, thought this blog would be appropriate. If you search Cybersecurity you might be put off by the fact it looks complex, difficult to learn and understand, and looks like none technical individuals will not understand it. In my opinion Cybersecurity can be easily learned and understood by anyone.<br><br>There are an abundance of information out there about which Cybersecurity tips is the best. Below are my tips I believe that are practical and applicable to the everday individuals.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Use passphrase as possible, for example <b>Oven-road10-Moonshine</b>. Consider using a reputable password manager to securely store your passwords for example Keepass and Bitwarden.</li><br>
                <li>Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) wherever possible. If possible use a hardware MFA such as Yubikeys. If you are going to use Yubikey get two, because the second Yubikey will be the backup in case the first Yubikey either gets lost, stolen, or destroyed. Website to Yubikey <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yubikey</a></li><br>
                <li>Regularly back up important data offline or on secure cloud services. Encrypt backups for added safety in case of ransomware attacks or device loss.</li><br>
                <li>Be extremely cautious of downloading and installing software onto your computer, going to unknown websites, or going to websites that may seem or feel legitimate.</li><br>
                <li>Keep software, applications, operating systems, and devices up to date with the latest security patches and update.</li><br>
                <li>Be extremely cautious of suspicious emails, texts, and links. Look for signs like misspellings, urgent requests, and unfamiliar sender addresses to avoid phishing scams.</li><br>
                <li>Be mindful of privacy settings on social media and limit sharing of personal information like address, full birth date, and travel plans.</li><br>
                <li>Use antivirus and anti-malware software and keep it updated to recognize and protect against threats. There are many personal antivirus to choose from. For me personally I use Malwarebytes, the freemium version.</li><br>
                <li>Avoid using public WiFi networks for sensitive transactions unless connected through a VPN. As much as possible use your home’s Wifi network or be hard wired (LAN connected).</li><br>
                <li>Secure WiFi routers by changing default passwords and enabling WPA2 or WPA3 encryption.</li><br>
                <li>Segerate your IoT devices(Alexa, Echo, wifi security camera, smart devices, etc) in a different network. An article about how to segerate your IoT devices, <a href="https://www.iotforall.com/secure-your-home-set-up-iot-devices-on-separate-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segerate your IoT devices</a></li><br>
                <li>Turn off Bluetooth and WiFi when not in use to minimize exposure to attacks.</li>
                </ul>
                If you feel my suggestions doesn't match with you, you are free to explore other options and other tips. That is the beauty of Cybersecurity, it is not one size fits all, you can customize it to whatever is your liking or your needs.<br><br>While Cybersecurity awareness month is in only October, technically Cybersecurity should be always continuous. I understand it may be daunting but make it a habit. One day it will be like muscle memory to you.Stay safe out there and always be vigilant.

                <h3>October 9, 2025</h3>
                <p>Keeping up with Cybersecurity news can be overwhelming as there are a lot resources to look at. For me personally there are two resource that is my go to.<br>
                <ul>
                <li><a href="https://packetstorm.news/news/main/page/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Packetstorm</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.cyber.gc.ca/en/alerts-advisories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadian Centre for Cybersecurity</a></li>
                </ul>
                For the more general overview news I go to reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/?rdt=35908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/cybersecurity.</a><br><br>If you search in google such as "cybersecurity news 2025" or somewhere along those lines, you will get many more resources.
