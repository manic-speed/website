        <h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my website. I was getting frustrated with LinkedIn. It is the fourth time my LinkedIn account got locked out or "banned". I confirmed I am not doing anything that either is suspicious or malicious. I don't know what their reasoning is for icing me out.<br><br>I decided to create a website. This is a static website, nothing fancy and straight to the point. Since I am not a web developer, I am learning as I go along. I will beautify this as I get going. The main objective of this website is to showcase myself and to connect/network with individual(s) or companies.<br><br>The contents on this website will be mostly about Cybersecurity, but I will also include none Cybersecurity contents.</p>
		<h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Miguel. I am based out of British Columbia, Canada. I am Cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience with offensive and defensive. I tend to lean more into the offensive side, but at the same time I still like the defensive side. I consider myself a "jack of all trades, master of none".This resonate with anyone in the Information Technology field or in the Cybersecurity field. Whatever the tasking(s) is, I will get it done.<br><br>Currently, I am actively seeking employment in a Cybersecurity role that would be either offensive or defensive. Ideally I would want the job to be local to me, but I am flexible if the job is fully remote.

                <h3>April 2024: Raspberry Pi wireless Penetration Test box</h3>
                <p>Configured a Raspberry Pi to a wireless Penetration Test box to learn wifi attack such on WPA2-PSK. I installed Kali Linux onto the Raspberry Pi. The built-in wifi adapter is compatible, so I was able to conduct a wireless Penetration Test. I used Aircrack-ng for the wifi attack.</p>

                <p>Configured a ESP32-CAM to be a camera. I used two resources to complete the project; <a href="https://lastminuteengineers.com/getting-started-with-esp32-cam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting started with a esp32-cam</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx09GFGgVwA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create a Wi-Fi Spy Camera with an ESP32-CAM</a>. The second link which is a youtube video was for me check it out from a different perspective.</p>
