        <h2>(~$ intro)</h2>
		<p>Welcome to my website. I was getting frustrated with LinkedIn because I keep getting locked out or getting "banned". I confirmed I am not doing anything suspicious or malicious. I don't know what their reasoning is for icing me out.<br><br>I decided to create a portfolio/website. This is a static website, nothing fancy and straight to the point. Since I am not a web developer I am learning as I go along, which at the same time I will beautify this. The main objective of this portfolio/website is to showcase myself and to connect/network with individual(s) or companies.<br><br>The contents will be mostly about cybersecurity, but I will also include none cybersecurity contents.</p>
		<h2>(~$ whoami)</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Miguel. I am based out of British Columbia, Canada. I am cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience with offensive and defensive. I tend to lean more into the offensive side, but at the same time I still like the defensive side. I consider myself a "jack of all trades, master of none".This resonate with anyone in the Information Technology field or in the cybersecurity field. Whatever the tasking(s) is, I will get it done. I am also an Open-source Intelligence (OSINT) practitioner. OSINT may look simple to most people, but the thought process is what fascinate me.<br><br>Currently, I am actively seeking employment in a cybersecurity role that would be either offensive or defensive. The job can be either full-time, part-time, or contract. Ideally, I would want the job to be local to me but I am flexible if the job is fully remote.
        <h3>Resume Highlights</h3>
		<p>Below is a highlight of my resume. For my full resume contact me by email, <b>ocean0racle@protonmail.com</b>, and I will provide it to you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ex-reservist in the Canadian Armed Forces as an armoured reconnaissance soldier.</li>
			<li>Worked 10 years in an MSP as a Security Analyst. Which I started from a Helpdesk/Technical Analyst role.</li>
			<li>On-going practice of offensive and defensive skills on various resources and cybersecurity related projects.</li>

                <h3>December 2025: Re-establishing a digital TV box and re-establishing a NAS</h3>
                <p>There were two projects I did with my significant other. The first was re-establishing the digital TV box and re-establishing the NAS.<br><br>First was re-establishing the digital TV box. This digital TV box hasn’t been active for 5+ years. Powered up the digital TV box to see if it still boots up. The digital TV box booted up fine but it was claiming there is no network connection.<br>I logged into the ISP’s wifi modem to see if the digital TV box is seen. The digital TV box is seen in the ISP's wifi modem. After doing a few power cycle of the digital TV box, decided to factory reset it. Did the factory reset and went through the process. During the process it said that no backup file was found. My significant other phoned Support and work with them. Support did something on their side, because after the digital TV box was rebooted it was going through the “first time setup” prompts. After an hour or so, the digital TV box seems to be operational but it is restarting and freezing often. Support said the digital TV box is quite old and most likely need to be replaced. A new digital TV box has been ordered and will replace the old one.<br><br>The second one is re-establishing the NAS. The NAS hasn't been powered on for quite some time too. But before powering the NAS, it needed to be dust free because dust has accumulated in it since it was last active. The NAS was taken apart and was vacuumed. Once most of the dust were vacuumed the NAS was reassembled. My significant other reassembled the NAS and powered back up. Confirmed the NAS is working. It needed to go through maintenance which my significant other took over. Other than that, the NAS is still operational and working like brand new.<br><br>This was a fun project that I tagged along. My significant other is such a nerd with technologies. It is always nice to have something in common.</p>

                <h3>October 2025: Smart TVs installation</h3>
                <p>Installed three Sony Bravia 65" Smart TV for a private client. The process wasn't difficult but the private client wasn't too comfortable of setting up the technical portion. Which was setting up the network, in this case it was WiFi, applying updates, linking up required Cloud accounts, install other streaming applications, reviewing additional configurations, and doing a final confirmation. Fortunately, I didn't have to do mount any brackets.<br><br>Even though this wasn't necessary cybersecurity related there was an element of IT, which was setting up the network. Plus, I get to get my hands dirty and do physical work.</p>

                <h3>April 2025: Team Rubicon Canada – Fire recovery and service project</h3>
                <p>This event was in two folds. It was a fire recovery project and a service project. I was part of the service project group.<br><br>The main task was building a fence. It was a great experience because I never built a fence and I got a lot of hands-on time with tools that I normally don't get to have. The tools I used was jigsaw, circular saw, reciprocating saw, hammer, impact wrench.<br><br>This event took me out of my comfort zone and learn a new life skill.</p>

                <h3>April 2025: Practical SOC Analyst (PSAA) lab</h3>
                <p>I built a virtualized environment that comprise of a virtual Ubuntu machine and a virtual Windows to practice various Blue Teaming TTP(tactics, techniques, procedures) such as network traffic analysis, log analysis, phishing analysis, and other methodologies.</p>Below are the following tools that were used.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wireshark</li>
                        <li>TCP Dump</li>

                <h3>March 2025: Team Rubicon Canada – Training event and service project</h3>
                <p>This was a training event and a service project. This is the first event I attended and get to meet the team.<br><br>I didn’t participate in the main training event, but I was heavily involved in the service project. The service project involved fire mitigation and vegetative debris removal. I used various tools in the service project tasking but the most interesting tool I used was the log splitter.</p>

                <p>My job hunt is quite discouraging. I am getting responses/call back and interviews from companies I applied to. Some of the interviews I felt like I bombed it, while other interviews I felt confident I did quite well. For the companies I felt like I did well in the interview, I get ghosted. Perhaps it is my lack of knowledge or I give “bad vibes”, but the part of getting ghosted is demoralizing. But luckily for me since I was in the Military, I have learned to embrace the pain, misery, ambiguity, and chaos.<br><br>Venting aside I am going to continue my job hunt. For others out there I hope your job hunt is way more successful than mine.</p>

This is an external link about the Microsoft outage, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/live/microsoft-down-major-outage-hits-azure-365-and-more-even-minecraft-affected" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft outage</a><br><br>As you can see DNS is a critical component that should be handled with extreme care. I understand mistakes happen, but this is not the first time it has happened. How can we make sure this never happens? Double, triple, etc check the DNS change before you apply or commit. Easier said than done, but you just need to take <b>ownership</b>. <b>No excuses</b>. But what do I know, I am just another cog in the machine.</p>

                <p>I volunteered for a cybersecurity event called SiberX: Operation Defend the North (Vancouver). This conference is new to me in a sense that it isn't the typical technical/hacking conference. The conference is a tabletop exercise. In my previous job when I was a IT Security Analyst, I participated in a tabletop exercise. So, a tabletop exercise wasn't new to me.<br><br>My role as a volunteer I was part of the command centre, which I oversee the tabletop exercise that was broadcast live on the internet and I also oversee the chat room. It was quite a unique experience for me. I enjoyed it. I would volunteer again for the next one.<br><br>Here is the website, <a href="https://siberx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SiberX</a>,for more information about the event and the organizer.</p>

                <p>On October 14, 2025 Microsoft has ended supporting Windows 10. But there is somewhat of a good news. Microsoft has the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program. This option is to continue getting security updates from Microsoft till <b>October 13, 2026</b>. This is the official link from Microsoft, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/extended-security-updates?r=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Extended Security Update Program</a>. In the end of the day Microsoft is forcing you to either upgrade your computer or buy a new computer.<br><br>There is another option that is better in my own opinion. This option is free, it is secure, not invasive of privacy, and has a supportive community. It is Linux. Yes, there are many Linux distrubtions (linux distro) out there but there are three that is quite user friendly. Below are those three Linux distro.
                <ul>
                    <li>Ubuntu</li>
                    <li>Linux Mint</li>
                    <li>MX Linux</li>
                </ul>Part of the installation process is you will to download the ISO image of the Linux distro, create a bootable USB flash drive, and boot your computer from the USB flash drive. Here is a link on the process of creating a bootable USB flash drive, <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-make-a-bootable-linux-usb-drive-on-pc-or-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Create bootable USB flash drive</a><br><br>Ubuntu is the most well-known and used Linux distro. Yes, it may look intimidating but you will be able to use it with ease in no time and be proficient at it. This is the link to Ubuntu,<a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubuntu download</a>. When you go the website, choose <b>Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS.</b><br><br>The next Linux distro is Linux Mint and MX Linux. These two Linux distro are Windows like, meaning the look and feel is like a Windows environment. But a caveat for MX Linux is, that it is hardware dependent. Below are the two Linux distro.
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux Mint</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://mxlinux.org/download-links/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MX Linux</a></li>
                </ul>I personally use Linux (Ubuntu) as my Operating System. I enjoy using it. But in the end of the day, it is your own decision of which Operation System you decide to use.</p>

                <h3>October 12, 2025</h3>
                <p>Since it is the obligatory cybersecurity awareness month, thought this blog would be appropriate. If you search cybersecurity you might be put off by the fact it looks complex, difficult to learn and understand, and looks like none technical individuals will not understand it. In my opinion cybersecurity can be easily learned and understood by anyone.<br><br>There are an abundance of information out there about which cybersecurity tips is the best. Below are my tips I believe that are practical and applicable to the everday individuals.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Use passphrase as possible, for example <b>Oven-road10-Moonshine</b>. Consider using a reputable password manager to securely store your passwords for example Keepass and Bitwarden.</li><br>
                <li>Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) wherever possible. If possible use a hardware MFA such as Yubikeys. If you are going to use Yubikey get two, because the second Yubikey will be the backup in case the first Yubikey either gets lost, stolen, or destroyed. Website to Yubikey <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yubikey</a></li><br>
                <li>Regularly back up important data offline or on secure cloud services. Encrypt backups for added safety in case of ransomware attacks or device loss.</li><br>
                <li>Be extremely cautious of downloading and installing software onto your computer, going to unknown websites, or going to websites that may seem or feel legitimate.</li><br>
                <li>Keep software, applications, operating systems, and devices up to date with the latest security patches and update.</li><br>
                <li>Be extremely cautious of suspicious emails, texts, and links. Look for signs like misspellings, urgent requests, and unfamiliar sender addresses to avoid phishing scams.</li><br>
                <li>Be mindful of privacy settings on social media and limit sharing of personal information like address, full birth date, and travel plans.</li><br>
                <li>Use antivirus and anti-malware software and keep it updated to recognize and protect against threats. There are many personal antivirus to choose from. For me personally I use Malwarebytes, the freemium version.</li><br>
                <li>Avoid using public WiFi networks for sensitive transactions unless connected through a VPN. As much as possible use your home’s Wifi network or be hard wired (LAN connected).</li><br>
                <li>Secure WiFi routers by changing default passwords and enabling WPA2 or WPA3 encryption.</li><br>
                <li>Segerate your IoT devices(Alexa, Echo, wifi security camera, smart devices, etc) in a different network. An article about how to segerate your IoT devices, <a href="https://www.iotforall.com/secure-your-home-set-up-iot-devices-on-separate-network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Segerate your IoT devices</a></li><br>
                <li>Turn off Bluetooth and WiFi when not in use to minimize exposure to attacks.</li>
                </ul>
                If you feel my suggestions doesn't match with you, you are free to explore other options and other tips. That is the beauty of cybersecurity, it is not one size fits all, you can customize it to whatever is your liking or your needs.<br><br>While cybersecurity awareness month is in only October, technically cybersecurity should be always continuous. I understand it may be daunting but make it a habit. One day it will be like muscle memory to you.Stay safe out there and always be vigilant.
